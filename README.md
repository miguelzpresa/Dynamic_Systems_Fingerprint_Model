# Project_Overview
This project aims to develop a model for fingerprint formation.

# Introduction
Fingerprints Growth formation pattern is dictated by highly complex interactions of multiple initial conditions, listed  below. The main goal is to compute the discrete equation of the paper " fingerprint formation model published in the scientific journal EUROPHYSICS LETTERS, "DOI: 10.1209/epl/i2004-10161-2""  this we Home will allow us to create fingerprints give a range of viable initial conditions.

 
## What are fingerprints?
Fingerprints are skin patterns with friction ridges. Our fingers, palms and soles are characterized by ridges (hills) and valleys (furrows). Their formation occurs during fetal development, beginning at approximately the 10th week of gestation, being completed by the 17th week, and remaining throughout life.

## What are the patterns of fingerprints? 
There are three basic patterns of fingerprints: 
* Whorls: Most complex, and contain central pocket, double loop, and accidental 
* Loops: Radial or  ulnar, depending on whether direction of slope of pattern is towards inner arm bone (radius) or outer arm bone (ulna) 
* Arches: Can be plain or tented

# Justification
### Why is it going to be done?
The biggest inspiration for this project comes from the work of Alan Turing's Patterns in Nature. Zebra stripes, cat coats, leopards and cheetahs are surprisingly unique, making stripes a tool to identify one animal from the rest, fingerprints are like our stripes.   


 Turing’s theory was elegant and simple: any repeating natural pattern could be created by the interaction of two things — molecules, cells, whatever — with particular characteristics. Through a mathematical principle he called ‘reaction–diffusion’, these two components would spontaneously self-organise into spots, stripes, rings, swirls or dappled blobs.

# Limitations
Physics and mathematical theory of embryology deals with highly complex dynamics systems ,some of them non-linear,its important to mention that we do not pretend to model the actual physical process of ridges formation(fingerprints),However ,the paper that we are analyzing gives an alternative approach,it takes the principal properties ,that we will list below ,to replicate the fingerprint formation during embryological process through ,multivariable calculus tools ,vectors spaces,and numerical methods.
#  Goals
* Get a better understanding of embryological process of epidermial ridge formation
* Tweak the  initial conditions to find those who generate the 3 principal patterns inf fingerprints classification  
* Quantify those parameters and analize them  
* Like any other Dynamic System,main goal is to be able to predict fingerprint form at any given point of time in the formation
* Find critical points,linear stability ,convergence points ,Limit cycles ,Local ,Global Bifurcation

* Study the model as a System and not as a simple ecuation
* Create our final report of findings
* And the funny  part  ,create our own fingerprints
* Check if the assumptions and observations that the paper gives are reproducible,and scalable

### How is it going to be done?
Compute a fingerprint formation model published in the scientific journal EUROPHYSICS LETTERS, "DOI: 10.1209/epl/i2004-10161-2" to generate fingerprints from initial parameters inserted by the user.


____
# Hipothesis
* Anisotropic laws are true (locally)(inplace stress distribution)
* Stability in the solutions of the ecuations
Given that no person has the same attributes than another person, the expected result is that no two fingerprints analyzed will be the same.
* The stress field anticipates the direction of the ridge system and also predicts in what  areas buckling will take place first
* Von Kallman Ecuations will perform as planned to calculate the buckling patterns
