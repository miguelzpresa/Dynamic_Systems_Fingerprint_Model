# Proyect_Overview:


____
# Hypothesis
Given that no person has the same attributes than another person, the expected result is that no two fingerprints analyzed will be the same.


## General Objectives (our Research Questions)
Fingerprints Growth formation pattern is dicted by highly complex interactions of múltiple inicial contions, listed  below , 
The main goal is to compute the discret ecuation of the paper "" published by , this we Home will allow us to create fingerprints give a range of viable inicial contions 
To Analize possible pattern designs,   


Be able to create fingerprints 
## Specific Objectives
* Create a set of functions to model fingerprints given certain characteristics
* Using real data, model the fingerprints with the given information of the person  
* Analize the patterns that are shown to us
* Declare standards for certain forms of fingerprints
